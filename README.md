How many hours I spend: 20-25hours total

For testing I did multiple things: 

Used print statements to test if my conditions are even getting satisfied or not
Splitting screen and side by side comparing outputs from what was given to me on canvas vs my output
As I dont have a linux machine, so i used a website that uses diff compare for comparing two outputs, through this I compared some outputs that might contain trivial spacing or some issues.
I finally used canvas's ambig and loop file to test my code, again and again on gradescore until I reach 14/14.
I resolved every issue, only the ctrl+D i couldnt solve because I dont have linux machine but I read that it works fine on linux. I also mentioned an exception of EOFERROR, so it should work fine with linux based machines.

f. Extensions;
    1. help: I used help the way what was asked to us. If you add something to the list of valid verbs help will recognize it but it will through a not implemented error. It will also have ... infront of go and get as mentioned.
    2. drop: I used drop for dropping items in a particular room, for example if i pick an item from one room and now i want to drop that item into another room that is not having any item list, then also it will handle that case properly by inserting the new item into a list by creating that list immediately.
    3. Winning and loosing conditions: I used winning and loosing conditions, by implementing a game for winning a chocolate. In this game, we want a chocolate but we need to pass the math quiz. Once you pass the math quiz, then only it will allow you to take chocolate from kitchen otherwise you wont get. And you wont be able to take the quiz again.
