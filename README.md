# CS-515-Project-1-Adventure

This project in CS 515-A is a text-based video game: players use text commands to explore a textual world. Text adventures were some of the first computer video games, offering an explorable world in narrative prose, full of puzzles, riddles, and mystery. Classics in the example include Colossal Cave AdventureLinks to an external site.—from which the name ‘adventure game’ comes—or ZorkLinks to an external site.. The 1980s were the heyday of this style of game, evolving into visual puzzle games like Monkey IslandLinks to an external site. and MystLinks to an external site. and multi-user, combat-oriented games like MUDsLinks to an external site., which evolved in MMORPGs like EverQuestLinks to an external site. and World of WarcraftLinks to an external site.
